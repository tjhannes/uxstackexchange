"6","False","Questions seeking **icon recommendations** are off-topic as they are rarely useful to others. Instead, ask for advice on how to represent a particular concept pictorially, and then take that advice and use it to find or create icons.

"7","False","Questions about **Implementation** are off-topic because this site is for User Experience design questions, not questions around *how* to implement these designs. Therefore, questions around the use of programs like Photoshop or languages such as CSS or JavaScript are off topic.","2013-07-10 11:05:15","3865","2013-07-10 13:02:28","7627","",""
"8","False","Questions about **Site Reviews** are off-topic because questions here are expected to be relevant for a variety of people in the same situation. Reviewing a site, flow or interface only helps one person at a specific time. Instead try to ask a focused question about a particular aspect of the design that solicits solutions, not opinions.","2013-07-10 11:06:20","3865","2013-07-10 13:02:34","7627","",""
"9","False","Questions requesting **Icon Suggestions** are off topic. While the subject of icons is on topic, there's very little value in soliciting suggestions for a specific icon in a specific context.
