It doesn't have to be of ""scientific quality"", just someone somewhere studying the matter and who came up with an answer to why kids open CRP's easier than adults.

Cross Channel within Information Architecture is also being revised and discussed on [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CrossChannel&src=typd) as well as the upcoming [Euro IA]( http://www.euroia.org/) event in Edinburgh later this month. Especially a talk by Adam Ungstad on the topic [“Metadata in the Cross-Channel Ecosystem — Consistency, Context and Interoperability”]( http://www.euroia.org/talk/cross-channel-ecosystem) and a workshop by Andrea Resmini called [“Being in Business with IA — Delivering Cross-channel UX”]( http://www.euroia.org/workshop/being-in-business-with-ia).

Because of that, I want to highlight this question and see if anyone else inside the UX.SE community has any further and/or different view on Cross Channel. Qualitative answers will receive my up-vote.","4679","4679"

"992","112852","11","2017-10-24 09:20:29","2017-10-31 16:07:11","","I’m trying to understand the discrepancy of user experience between chatting on live videos on different large social platforms.

The issue is that maybe in the bulk of all chat messages there are some interesting ones, but for example, YouTube doesn’t allow for upvoting of a chat message during a live video, and after the live video ended, the chat is deleted and comments are enabled.
  	 	
On Facebook, you can like chat messages, and when the live is over, they are transformed to comments and sorted by Top Comments based on likes. Also, replies are now enabled (you can reply to a comment but not to a chat message), you can also change from Top Comments to Live and see comments appear as they appeared during the live. 
  	 	
On Twitch, chat is preserved (after the live), and if you replay the video, the chat is as it happened, and you can comment at that second in the video even though the video is over.

Why the discrepancy between them? And what’s the best way to surface good comments? As Facebook does? Or is there a better way or a better combination of UI / UX Features that would make things better?","108150","108150"
